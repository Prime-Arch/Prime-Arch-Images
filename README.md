# Prime Arch – Visual Assets Repository

This repository contains visual assets used in Prime Arch materials such as education, articles, workshops, and architectural reasoning.
The images are intentionally published as static, publicly accessible resources and are primarily referenced from external knowledge systems (e.g. ProMind).

The images **do not stand on their own**. Their meaning is carried by the surrounding text and context where they are referenced.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:

* Provide **stable, permanent URLs** for Prime Arch visuals
* Enable consistent referencing of images from text-based knowledge systems
* Separate **visual assets** from **semantic interpretation**
* Avoid heavy image management or DAM tooling

This repository is **not** intended to be a complete or self-explanatory documentation of Prime Arch.

---

## Repository Structure

All assets are located under the top-level folder:

```
assets/
```

Assets are organized by Prime Arch dimensions:

```
assets/
├── capability/
├── process/
├── information/
├── organization/
├── governance/
└── ...
```

Each folder contains image files relevant to that dimension.

---

## Naming Conventions

Image filenames follow semantic, stable naming conventions:

```
pa-<dimension>-<concept>[-variant].png
```

Examples:

* `pa-capability-levels.png`
* `pa-process-end-to-end-flow.png`
* `pa-information-concepts-v1.png`

Guidelines:

* Use lowercase letters and hyphens
* Avoid spaces, dates, or words like `final`, `new`, `updated`
* Only use version suffixes (`v1`, `v2`) when the *meaning* of the image changes

Git history is used for tracking minor updates.

---

## How These Images Are Used

Images in this repository are typically referenced from external text, for example:

* Editorial analyses
* Educational explanations
* Architectural reasoning
* Knowledge projects in ProMind

The **text is the primary carrier of meaning**.
The image acts as a visual anchor.

If you encounter an image here without context, that is expected.

---

## Editorial Principle

This repository follows a strict editorial principle:

> Images are published **when they are needed**, not to achieve completeness.

There is no ambition to upload or index all historical Prime Arch visuals upfront.
Only images that are actively used in reasoning, education, or analysis are added.

---

## Licensing & Access

The images are publicly accessible for technical reasons (GitHub Pages).
They are not intended for unrestricted reuse outside their original Prime Arch context.

If you are unsure about usage rights, assume the content is **context-bound**.

---

## For Contributors

If you are adding images:

1. Place them under the correct dimension folder
2. Use the established naming convention
3. Ensure the image has a clear purpose and is referenced from text
4. Do not add images “just in case”

Editorial discipline matters more than coverage.

---

## Final Note

This repository is deliberately simple.

* No database
* No metadata schema
* No heavy tooling

Structure, naming, and context are enough.

The thinking lives elsewhere.
